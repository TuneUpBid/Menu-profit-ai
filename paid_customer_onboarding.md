## Day 1 – Implementation Tips

**Subject:** How to apply your menu recommendations

Hi {{first_name}},

By now you’ve hopefully reviewed your analysis report. Here are three ways to put it into action:

1. **Adjust pricing**: Aim for food cost percentages around 28–32 %【263601965871716†L206-L214】. For dishes below that range, consider promotions; for those above it, raise prices or streamline ingredients.
2. **Promote high‑margin items**: Use server training and menu design to highlight pastas, desserts and salads, which typically carry high markups【179994080388295†L195-L204】【179994080388295†L224-L233】.
3. **Bundle strategically**: Offer combos pairing low‑margin entrées with high‑margin sides and drinks to increase average check size.
