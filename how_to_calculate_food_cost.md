# How to Calculate Food Cost Percentage and Prime Cost

Food costs are one of the largest expenses for any restaurant. Knowing how much it costs to produce each menu item – and how that cost compares to your selling price – is essential for profitable pricing. Two related metrics help owners understand the relationship between costs and sales: **food cost percentage** and **prime cost**.

## What is food cost percentage?

Food cost percentage represents the ratio of your cost of ingredients to the revenue generated from selling those dishes. In other words, it tells you what portion of each sales dollar is spent on food and beverage. Restaurant365 explains that a general rule of thumb in the industry is to keep food cost percentages **around 28–32 %**【263601965871716†L206-L214】. This range varies by concept; quick‑service restaurants often operate on lower percentages than fine‑dining establishments. 

### Calculating food cost percentage

To calculate your food cost percentage for a period:

1. Add your **beginning inventory** and **purchases** for the period.
2. Subtract the **ending inventory** to determine your **cost of goods sold (CoGS)**.
3. Divide CoGS by your **sales revenue** during the same period.

For example, if your beginning food inventory is $8 000, you purchase $4 000 worth of food during the week, and end with $6 000 of inventory, your CoGS is $6 000 (8 000 + 4 000 – 6 000). If you did $20 000 in sales, your food cost percentage would be $6 000 ÷ $20 000 = **30 %**【667034930854081†L142-L156】.

Monitoring this metric helps ensure that your menu pricing supports your desired profit margin. If your food cost percentage is consistently above the recommended range (around 28–32 %), you may need to adjust pricing, renegotiate supply costs or reduce waste.

## Understanding prime cost

While food cost percentage focuses solely on ingredients, **prime cost** accounts for both cost of goods sold and labor. Baker Tilly notes that prime cost targets typically range from **58 % to 62 % of sales**【667034930854081†L113-L116】; exceeding 65 % can make profitability challenging for most restaurants. Prime cost is calculated by adding your CoGS and labor costs and dividing by total sales.

For example, if your CoGS is 30 % of sales and your labor cost is 35 %, your prime cost would be 65 %. Baker Tilly warns that hitting such a high prime cost can erode profits【667034930854081†L113-L123】. They also emphasize that in some cases your CoGS may be **as high as 40 % or more** if your labor cost is very low【667034930854081†L120-L124】; it’s the combination of CoGS and labor that matters most.

### Tips for managing prime cost

* **Set targets**: Establish a prime cost target (e.g., 60 %) and communicate it to your team【667034930854081†L113-L123】.
* **Take regular inventory**: Weekly inventory counts help identify waste and variance early【667034930854081†L193-L199】.
* **Control purchases and portion sizes**: Purchasing only what you need and pre‑portioning ingredients reduces waste and over‑portioning【667034930854081†L208-L223】.
* **Update costs frequently**: Ingredient prices change often. Update recipe costs and menu prices accordingly【667034930854081†L204-L209】.

## Why these metrics matter

Food cost percentage and prime cost provide a financial framework for menu pricing. By regularly calculating these metrics and comparing them to industry benchmarks, you can make data‑driven decisions about menu design, pricing and operations. Keeping food cost percentage within the recommended 28–32 % range【263601965871716†L206-L214】 and managing prime cost around 60 % of sales【667034930854081†L113-L116】 helps ensure that your restaurant remains profitable without sacrificing quality.
