# Menu Engineering: Profit Margins by Dish Type

Not all dishes contribute equally to your bottom line. Menu engineering involves understanding which items drive profit and strategically designing your menu to highlight them. By analyzing ingredient costs, typical markups and perceived value, you can adjust pricing and placement to maximize profitability.

## Desserts deliver big markups

Desserts often carry some of the highest markups on a menu. According to a report on restaurant pricing, restaurants typically mark up their cake costs by **200 % to 300 %**【179994080388295†L158-L160】. Guests see desserts as a special treat and expect to pay more, allowing you to price them significantly above their ingredient costs. Just be sure that your menu highlights these indulgent offerings and makes them hard to resist.

## Pasta and staples are low‑cost, high‑margin

Staple foods such as pasta and risotto have very low ingredient costs. The same report notes that most pasta dishes cost between **$2 and $3.50 to make**, while casual Italian restaurants might sell them for around **$9**, a markup of roughly **350 %**【179994080388295†L195-L204】. Adding simple extras like sautéed mushrooms or olives can increase perceived value and profit margins even further. Feature a few premium pasta dishes prominently on your menu to capitalize on this high margin category.

## Salads contribute to profitability

Salads may seem modestly priced, but they play an important role in hitting food cost targets. A chicken Caesar salad — eight ounces of chicken breast, two cups of romaine, dressing, Parmesan and croutons — typically costs restaurants **around $3.12** to make but sells for **$10 to $12**【179994080388295†L224-L233】. That’s a markup of more than 200 %. Positioning salads as healthy or premium choices can drive sales while maintaining healthy profit margins.

## Side dishes and beverages are hidden profit drivers

Simple sides like mashed potatoes, broccoli or rice often repurpose ingredients already on hand. A restaurant might charge **$2.69** for an eight‑ounce side of mashed potatoes, while the same portion costs just **46 cents** to make at home【179994080388295†L249-L259】. Non‑alcoholic beverages are even more profitable: a glass of soda costs the restaurant pennies but may be marked up by more than **1 150 %**【179994080388295†L261-L268】. Ensure that every entrée comes with profitable add‑ons such as sides, drinks or desserts to increase the average check.

## Menu engineering tips

1. **Highlight high‑margin items:** Use boxes, icons or call‑outs to draw attention to dishes with strong margins such as pasta and desserts.
2. **Bundle strategically:** Offer combos or prix‑fixe options that pair lower‑margin entrées with high‑margin sides and beverages.
3. **Monitor costs:** Ingredient prices fluctuate. Regularly review your recipe costs and adjust menu prices or portion sizes accordingly.
4. **Train servers:** Encourage staff to upsell high‑margin items like desserts, cocktails and premium sides.

By understanding the cost structure of each dish and intentionally designing your menu, you can steer customers toward items that both satisfy them and boost your profits.
