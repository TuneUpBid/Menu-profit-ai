"""
Script for scraping restaurant data from Google Maps or other sources.

This module contains functions to identify and collect contact information for independent
restaurants in a specified city. Due to API key requirements and rate limits, this
script uses placeholders where external services would normally be called. To enable
actual scraping, provide your Google Places API key (or other service keys) via
environment variables and uncomment the appropriate sections.
